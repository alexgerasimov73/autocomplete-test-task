# README

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
This is the basic part of the component with auto-complete. For a better user experience I can finalize the following parts, but this will take a little more time:

- better realization for styles
- supporting label for the Input, icons, infinity load, and other
- outside click event for hidding dropdown
- component can have multiselect selections
- some tests


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.


### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
